# Welcome to My Personal Website!
#### This repository contains a series of projects exploring various topics in image processing and computer vision. Below is an overview of the projects organized by folder:
#### It only contains my project for computer vision right now, more to be updated in the future :)

### **Folder /1: Image Alignment**
- **Description:** Aligning historical images of the Russian Empire using normalized cross-correlation.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Image alignment
  - Normalized cross-correlation (NCC)
  - Multi-scale image processing
  - Image Pyramid

### **Folder /2: Low Pass Filter and Frequency Analysis**
- **Description:** Exploring the effects of low-pass filtering and analyzing images in the frequency domain.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Derivative of gaussian filter
  - Image sharpening and hybrid image
  - Fast Fourier transform (FFT)
  - Gaussian and Laplacian stacks

### **Folder /3: Face Morphing**
- **Description:** Creating face morphing effects using affine transformations.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Defining correspondences for Delaunay triangulation
  - Affine transformations
  - Image interpolation and extrapolation

### **Folder /4: Image Warping and Mosaicing**
- **Description:** Warp and mosaic images using homography matrices with the same center of projection. Automate the process by feature matching and autostitching.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Homography transformation
  - Automatic feature detection and matching 
  - Distance blending on the overlapping region

### **Folder /5: Diffusion Models and UNet Implementation**
- **Description:** Working with pre-trained diffusion models and implementing a UNet architecture for diffusion from scratch.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Denoising, sampling, and classifier free guidance
  - Image to image translation and inpainting
  - Diffusion models
  - UNet architecture

### **Folder /final: Perspective Transformation in Anamorphic Art**
- **Description:** Performing perspective transformation in a film video with assistance from the Segment Anything Model (SAM).
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Perspective transformation with homography
  - Segment Anything Model (SAM)
  - Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)

    <p> Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii, a famous photographer who won Tzar's special permission to travel across 
        the vast Russian Empire and take color photographs of everything he saw. ALthough there was not a way to print color photographs in his era, 
        he came up with a simple yet genious idea - record three exposures of every scene onto a glass plate using a red, a green, and a blue filter.
        Later, the revolution began and right after, he left Russia in 1918, never to return again. Fortunately, his RGB glass plate negatives, capturing 
        the last years of the Russian Empire, survived and were purchased in 1948 by the Library of Congress (LOC). The LoC has recently digitized the 
        negatives and made them available online.

        The goal of this project is to automate the production of a color image given the three channels of the same image, in particular the digitized
        Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images!

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p>In this project, only x-y translation model is applied due to the interest of time. In accordance to project guidances, I used the blue channel 
    as the reference channel, subsequently align the red and green channels to the blue channel. I will explain the my attempt in producing a color image
    with few visual artifacts.</p>

    <p> Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii, a famous photographer who won Tzar's special permission to travel across 
        the vast Russian Empire and take color photographs of everything he saw. ALthough there was not a way to print color photographs in his era, 
        he came up with a simple yet genious idea - record three exposures of every scene onto a glass plate using a red, a green, and a blue filter.
        Later, the revolution began and right after, he left Russia in 1918, never to return again. Fortunately, his RGB glass plate negatives, capturing 
        the last years of the Russian Empire, survived and were purchased in 1948 by the Library of Congress (LOC). The LoC has recently digitized the 
        negatives and made them available online.
